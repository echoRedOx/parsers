# Data Extraction Utility Toolset

## Overview

This project is a utility toolset designed for extracting structured data from various unstructured sources, including text files, PDFs, tabular data, and web content. The primary focus is to convert these diverse formats into a standardized JSON format, facilitating easier data manipulation and analysis.

## Purpose

A toolset for reliable and flexible way to extract and structure data from commonly encountered formats, consistently to my liking. Whether books from Project Gutenberg, digitized PDFs, or scraping web content, this toolset should help convert these sources into a consistent, machine-readable JSON format.

### Current Focus

- **Text Data Extraction**: The toolset includes utilities for parsing text, splitting it into meaningful segments, and organizing these segments into structured JSON data.
- **PDF Extraction**: Utility to handle PDF files with PyMuPDF + their PyMuPDF4LLM package, extracting text and metadata, and converting them.
- **Tabular Data**: Adding support for tabular data formats like CSV and Excel, enabling seamless extraction and conversion to JSON.
- **Web Scraping**: Incorporating web scraping capabilities to extract data from HTML and other web-based formats, with the same goal of producing structured JSON output. (someday)

This toolset is intended to be a versatile solution for anyone needing to streamline the process of data extraction and conversion across various formats, namely and especially me.
